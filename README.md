# RapidRAW

> A beautiful, non-destructive, and GPU-accelerated RAW image editor built with performance in mind.

RapidRAW is a modern, high-performance alternative to Adobe Lightroom®. It delivers a simple, beautiful editing experience in a lightweight package (under 20MB) for Windows, macOS, and Linux.

I developed this project as a personal challenge at the age of 18. My goal was to create a high-performance tool for my own photography workflow while deepening my understanding of both React and Rust, with the support from Google Gemini.

<details>
<summary><strong>For Who Is This?</strong></summary>
RapidRAW is for photographers who love to edit their photos in a <strong>clean, fast, and simple workflow</strong>. It prioritizes speed, a beautiful user interface, and powerful tools that let you achieve your creative color vision quickly.
<br><br>
It is <strong>not</strong> for users who seek absolute, perfect color accuracy. While the results are great for most purposes, the focus is on a fluid, creative process rather than perfect color precision.
<br><br>
RapidRAW is still in active development and isn't yet as polished as mature tools like Darktable, RawTherapee, or Adobe Lightroom®. Right now, the focus is on building a fast, enjoyable core editing experience. You may encounter bugs - if you do, please report them so I can fix them :) Your feedback really helps!

## The Idea

#### The Motivation
As a photography enthusiast, I often found existing software to be sluggish and resource-heavy on my machine. Born from the desire for a more responsive and streamlined photo editing experience, I set out to build my own. The goal was to create a tool that was not only fast but also helped me learn the details of digital image processing and camera technology.

#### The Challenge
I set an ambitious goal to rapidly build a functional, feature-rich application from an empty folder. This personal challenge pushed me to learn quickly and focus intensely on the core architecture and user experience.

#### The Process
The foundation is built on Rust for its safety and performance, and Tauri for its ability to create lightweight, cross-platform desktop apps with a web frontend. The entire image processing pipeline is offloaded to the GPU via WGPU and a custom WGSL shader, ensuring that even on complex edits with multiple masks, the UI remains fluid.

I am **immensely grateful for Google's Gemini suite of AI models.** As an 18-year-old without a formal background in advanced mathematics or image science, the AI Studio's free tier was an invaluable assistant, helping me research and implement concepts like the Menon demosaicing algorithm.

## Current Priorities

While the core functionality is in place, I'm actively working on improving several key areas. Here's a transparent look at the current focus:

| Task                                                                                         | Priority | Difficulty | Status |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|------------|--------|
| Refactoring the frontend (reduce prop drilling in React components)                         | Medium   | Medium     | [ ]    |
| Allow 45°+ rotation for images (e.g. predefined 90° clockwise )                             | Medium   | Low       | [X]    |
| Improving the dehaze tool for more natural results                                           | Low     | Medium     | [X]    |
| Optimize image transport (replace Base64 for better performance)                            | Low     | Medium     | [ ]    |
| Add AI-generated masks using [Segment Anything](https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything) | High | Medium    | [X]    |
| Implement a simple MVP of the ComfyUI based AI Roadmap                                        | Low   | High       | [X]    |
| Sign macOS builds using a registered developer account                                       | Medium      | Low     | [ ]    |
| Switch to a better rawloader (e.g. rawler)                                                   | High      | Medium     | [X]    |
| Improve speed on older systems (e.g. Pascal GPUs)                                            | Medium   | High       | [ ]    |
| Auto white balance detection and exposure correction                                         | Medium     | Medium     | [X]    |

## AI Roadmap

RapidRAW features a two-tier approach to AI to provide both speed and power. It distinguishes between lightweight, integrated tools and heavy, optional generative features.

1.  **Built-in AI Masking:** The core application includes lightweight, fast and open source AI models (SAM from Meta) for intelligent masking (e.g., Subject and Foreground selection). These tools run locally, are always available, and are designed to accelerate your standard editing workflow.

2.  **Optional Generative AI:** For computationally intensive tasks like inpainting (Generative Replace), RapidRAW connects to an external ComfyUI backend. This keeps the main application small and fast, while offloading heavy processing to a dedicated, user-run server.

### Current Status: Generative AI is in Developer Preview

> The **Built-in AI Masking** is fully functional for all users.
>
> The **Optional Generative AI** features, however, currently require a manual setup of a [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) backend. The official, easy-to-use Docker container is **not yet provided**.
>
> This means the generative tools are considered a **developer preview** and are not ready for general, out-of-the-box use.

</p>
</details>

### Foundational Generative Integration

The initial work on generative AI focused on building a connection to the ComfyUI backend and implementing the first key features.

*   **Modular Backend:** RapidRAW connects to a local ComfyUI server, which acts as the inference engine.
*   **Generative Replace (Inpainting):** Users can paint a mask over an area of the image (or use the AI masking tool to create a precise selection) and provide a text prompt to fill that area with generated content.
*   **Non-Destructive Patches:** Each generative edit is stored as a separate "patch" layer. These can be toggled, re-ordered, or deleted at any time, consistent with RapidRAW's non-destructive philosophy.

<details>
<summary><strong>The Technical Approach for Generative AI</strong></summary>
<br>
The integration is designed as follows:

1.  **Optional Backend:** Users who want generative features can run an official, pre-configured Docker container which launches a ComfyUI server with all necessary models and custom nodes.
2.  **Automatic Detection:** RapidRAW automatically detects if the local ComfyUI server is running and enables the generative AI tools in the UI.
3.  **Workflow-Based Execution:** When a user triggers a generative action (e.g., "Generative Replace"), RapidRAW sends the source image, mask, and text prompt to the ComfyUI server along with a specific, predefined workflow JSON.
4.  **Backend Processing:** The Docker container handles all the heavy processing on the GPU, executing the Stable Diffusion workflow.
5.  **Seamless Integration:** The resulting image (the generated patch) is sent back to RapidRAW and composited into the editor as a patch onto the source image.

This approach ensures that RapidRAW's core experience remains fast and lightweight, while providing an extensible path for optional, powerful AI features.

</details>

## Getting Started

You have two options to run RapidRAW:

**1. Download the Latest Release (Recommended)**

Grab the pre-built installer or application bundle for your operating system from the [**Releases**](https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW/releases) page.

**2. Build from Source**

If you want to build the project yourself, you'll need to have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/CyberTimon/RapidRAW.git
cd RapidRAW

# 2. Install frontend dependencies
npm install

# 3. Build and run the application in development mode
# Use --release for a build that runs much faster (image loading etc.)
npx tauri dev --release
```

## System Requirements

RapidRAW is built to be lightweight and cross-platform. The minimum (tested) requirements are:

*   **Windows:** Windows 10 or newer
*   **macOS:** macOS 13 (Ventura) or newer
*   **Linux:** Ubuntu 22.04+ or a compatible modern distribution

### Common Problems
<details>
<summary>Linux Wayland/WebKit Crash</summary>

If RapidRAW crashes on Wayland (e.g. GNOME + NVIDIA), try launching it with:

```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_DMABUF_RENDERER=1 RapidRAW
```
or
```bash
WEBKIT_DISABLE_COMPOSITING_MODE=1 RapidRAW
```

This issue is related to **WebKit** and **NVIDIA drivers**, not RapidRAW directly. Switching to **X11** or using **AMD / Intel GPUs** may also help.
